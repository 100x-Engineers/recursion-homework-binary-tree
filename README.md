# Recursion Homework: Depth and Breadth First Searches

## This repo has:

1. A recursive function, `depthFirstInsert`, that uses a depth-first approach to tree insertion.
2. An imperative function, `breadthFirstTraverse`, that uses a bread-first approach to tree traversal.
3. Tests for verifying the output of both functions.

## What does the code do?

1. Let's take a random string made up of numbers 0 to 9 and letters a to f. (String has no other elements except [0123456789abcdef]).
2. `depthFirstInsert` creates a simple binary tree -- all elements lower than the root go to the left side and all elements greater than the root go the right side of the tree. Each element is inserted as a leaf element.

## Your task
Write recursive function in iterative/imperative fashion.
Write the iterative function in a recursive fashion.
